### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Doriane ! I'm a French developer that creates projects to pass the time and occupy my mind.

###  :us: Languages

Such as written in my bio, I develop softwares using **C/C++** and sometimes the devil's language (**Java**). Since somes months, I create websites as a front-end dev using **HTML5 & CSS3**. I'm actually learning **JavaScript**, **Angular**, **React** and **Vue** to improves the pages.

###  :hammer: Projects

I'm actually working on several projects :

- Polynomial solver (Polynomia) : A sofware on Windows (.exe) developed in C that helps people who are doing polynomial calculus to resolve quadratic polynomial equations. The software displays the Delta value, x0, x1 and x2, the Canonic and the Factored form. To use it, you have access to the .ZIP file. You'll have the installation file to run. A new version will be released soon in which the steps to reach the factored form and the canonic form will be clarified.
- Satyin : A website serving as a portfolio on which you can access to my experience, projects, and social networks. You also have my contact informations, to ask for a project or only to talk with me.
- Convertor : A unit converter website that converts several data, such as currency, time, length, temperature, area, and more ! It will be available in a few months...

***Other projects are being developed and created, but further. Some are not listed above !***
